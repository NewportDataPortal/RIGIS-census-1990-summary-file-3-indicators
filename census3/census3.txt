      Median and Percentage Data M1-65
      As computed from STF3A Source Data by Databasics.
      Almost all valuess are ratios expressed as percentages.  
      This is usually composed of two items--a numerator
      (labeled "N:") divided by a denominator (labeled "D:"), to create a percentage.  For
      example, FOR M1, the percent of persons age 25 or over that completed college is computed by
      dividing the number of completing college (the numerator) by the total population age 25 or
      over for the block group (the denominator).
